 For future moon exploration missions, there is a need for accurate 3D mapping of the moon's
 surface. Also, due to the lack of facilities such as GPS, locating on the surface of the moon is
 also a major challenge. Using the simultaneous location and mapping algorithm (SLAM) on the
 crawler robot, in addition to creating a 3D map of the surrounding environment in the form of
 point clouds, it also has the ability to detect the position and status of the robot on the map.
 Also, the created maps can be used to perform tasks such as route planning and avoiding
 obstacles, for this purpose, the DBSCAN algorithm has also been used. The aim of this project
 is to design a surface-climbing robot that can move in an unknown environment and produce a
 3D mapin addition to location, and avoid obstacles in its path. Due to the high cost of the
 equipment, the implementation has been done as hardware in the loop (HIL).
